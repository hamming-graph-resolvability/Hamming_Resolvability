# Hamming_Resolvability
This project contains Python and Matlab scripts for checking resolvability on Hamming graphs. There are three methods implemented: Groebner bases(Python), Brute-force(Python), and Integer Linear Programming(Matlab). Last update: June 2019.

## Repository Organization
The Matlab ILP directory holds all of the Matlab scripts used for the integer linear programming solution. The scripts can be ran inside Matlab.

The Runtime scripts directory holds all of the Python and Matlab scripts used to perform and time resolvability checks with all three methods. There are test sets and results included so the scripts can be run through command line without any pre-processing.
